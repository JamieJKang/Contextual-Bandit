# High-dimensional Nonlinear Contextual Bandits
We study contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms in the setting where the expected rewards depend nonlinearly on a high-dimensional context vector. For simplicity, we focus on the 2-armed bandit model, but our work can be extended to more than two arms. We use nonparametric methods and compare their performance with the literature models.
